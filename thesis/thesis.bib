abstract = {A method is developed for calculating the effects of a strong oscillating field on two states of a quantum-mechanical system which are connected by a matrix element of the field. Explicit approximate solutions are obtained for a variety of special cases, and the results of numerical computations are given for others. The effect of an rf field on the J=2→1 l-type doublet microwave absorption lines of OCS has been studied in particular both experimentally and theoretically. Each line was observed to split into two components when the frequency of the rf field was near 12.78 Mc or 38.28 Mc, which are the frequencies separating the J=1 and J=2 pairs of levels, respectively. By measuring the rf frequency, $\nu$0, at which the microwave lines are split into two equally intense components, one may determine the separation between the energy levels. The measured value of $\nu$0 depends upon the intensity of the rf field and the form of this dependence has been calculated and found to be in good agreement with the experimental results.},

In addition to their fundamental interest, these efforts are stimulated by practical possibilities, such as the development of a quantum memory for photonic states. Controlled localization and storage of photonic pulses may also allow novel approaches to manipulating of light via enhanced nonlinear optical processes. Recently, electromagnetically induced transparency was used to reduce the group velocity of propagating light pulses and to reversibly map propagating light pulses into stationary spin excitations in atomic media. Here we describe and experimentally demonstrate a technique in which light propagating in a medium of Rb atoms is converted into an excitation with localized, stationary electromagnetic energy, which can be held and released after a controllable interval. Our method creates pulses of light with stationary envelopes bound to an atomic spin coherence, offering new possibilities for photon state manipulation and nonlinear optical processes at low light levels.},

As a consequence, it is possible to attain an optical depth which implies high fidelity extinction, from a monolayer. Using realistic experimental parameters, we also model how lattice vacancies and the atomic trapping depth affect the transmission, concluding that such high extinction should be possible, using current experimental techniques.},

abstract = {In computational dealings with splines, the question of representation is of primary importance. For splines of fixed order on a fixed partition, this is a question of choice of basis, since such splines form a linear space. Only three kinds of bases for spline spaces have actually been given serious attention; those consisting of truncated power functions, of cardinal splines, and of B-splines. Truncated power bases are known to be open to severe ill- conditioning, while cardinal splines are difficult to calculate. By contrast, bases consisting of B-splines are well-conditioned, at least for orders < 20. Such bases are also local in the sense that at every point only a fixed number (equal to the order) of B-splines is nonzero. B-splines are also evaluated quite easily, using their definition as a divided difference of the truncated power function. Unfortunately, such calculations are ill-conditioned, particularly for partitions of widely varying interval lengths, as is indicated by the fact that special measures have to be taken in case of coincident knots. In this note, a different way of evaluating B-splines is discussed which is very well conditioned yet efficient, and which needs no special adjustments in case of coincident knots. It is also shown that the condition of the B-spline basis increases exponentially with the order.},

abstract = {After a brief summary of the ideas underlying the quantum theory of dispersion it is shown that it can be applied to the refraction of x-rays, although the assumption that the number of atoms in a wave length cube is large is no longer satisfied. A general formula for the index of refraction in terms of the atomic absorption coefficient $\alpha$ and the critical frequencies is given. From the condition, experimentally verified, that the electrons in the atom for impressed frequencies, large compared to their natural frequencies, shall act like free electrons as far as the index of refraction is concerned, a relation is obtained for $\alpha$. From the failure of this relation when applied to the groups of electrons separately, conclusions are drawn as to the coupling of the groups. Some considerations on the origin of the Compton shifted radiation are added, from which it appears that in the wave description this radiation must be regarded as coming from all the atoms and as being coherent with the incident waves; a result suited to stress the difficulty of harmonizing the wave picture with that of quantum processes in the atoms.1},

abstract = {It is known that Maxwell's electrodynamics—as usually understood at the present time—when applied to moving bodies, leads to asymmetries which do not appear to be inherent in the phenomena. Take, for example, the recipro-cal electrodynamic action of a magnet and a conductor. The observable phe-nomenon here depends only on the relative motion of the conductor and the magnet, whereas the customary view draws a sharp distinction between the two cases in which either the one or the other of these bodies is in motion. For if the magnet is in motion and the conductor at rest, there arises in the neighbour-hood of the magnet an electric field with a certain definite energy, producing a current at the places where parts of the conductor are situated. But if the magnet is stationary and the conductor in motion, no electric field arises in the neighbourhood of the magnet. In the conductor, however, we find an electro-motive force, to which in itself there is no corresponding energy, but which gives rise—assuming equality of relative motion in the two cases discussed—to elec-tric currents of the same path and intensity as those produced by the electric forces in the former case. Examples of this sort, together with the unsuccessful attempts to discover any motion of the earth relatively to the " light medium, " suggest that the phenomena of electrodynamics as well as of mechanics possess no properties corresponding to the idea of absolute rest. They suggest rather that, as has already been shown to the first order of small quantities, the same laws of electrodynamics and optics will be valid for all frames of reference for which the equations of mechanics hold good. 1 We will raise this conjecture (the purport of which will hereafter be called the " Principle of Relativity ") to the status of a postulate, and also introduce another postulate, which is only apparently irreconcilable with the former, namely, that light is always propagated in empty space with a definite velocity c which is independent of the state of motion of the emitting body. These two postulates suffice for the attainment of a simple and consistent theory of the electrodynamics of moving bodies based on Maxwell's theory for stationary bodies. The introduction of a " luminiferous ether " will prove to be superfluous inasmuch as the view here to be developed will not require an " absolutely stationary space " provided with special properties, nor},

abstract = {The interference of a discrete autoionized state with a continuum gives rise to characteristically asym- metric peaks in excitation spectra. The earlier qualitative interpretation of this phenomenon is extended and revised. A theoretical formula is fitted to the shape of the 2s2p 'P resonance of He observed in the inelastic scattering of electrons. The fitting determines the parameters of the 2s2p 'P resonance as follows: 8=60.1 ev, 1'{\~{}}0.04 ev, f 2 to 4){\&}10 '. The theory is extended to the interaction oi one discrete level with two or more continua and of a set of discrete levels with one continuum. The theory can also give the position and in- tensity shifts produced in a Rydberg series of discrete levels by interaction with a level of another configura- tion. The connection with the nuclear theory of resonance scattering is indicated.},

The properties of dark-state polaritons such as the group velocity are determined by the mixing angle between light and matter components and can be controlled by an external coherent field as the pulse propagates. In particular, light pulses can be decelerated and "trapped" in which case their shape and quantum state are mapped onto metastable collective states of matter. Possible applications of this reversible coherent-control technique are discussed.},

Furthermore, we derive an optimal control strategy for storage and retrieval of a photon wave packet of any given shape.

In particular, by using gradient ascent to shape classical control pulses used to mediate photon storage, we open up the possibility of high efficiency photon storage in the non-adiabatic limit, in which analytical solutions to the equations of motion do not exist. This control shaping technique enables an order-of-magnitude increase in the bandwidth of the memory. We also demonstrate that the often discussed connection between time reversal and optimality in photon storage follows naturally from gradient ascent. Finally, we discuss the optimization of controlled reversible inhomogeneous broadening.},

It is shown that the interaction adiabaticity strongly depends on the relationship between oscillator strengths. A simple expression specifying the critical propagation length at which the stimulated Raman adiabatic passage process is still effective is derived. An estimate of the propagation distance at which a complete energy transfer from the pump pulse into the Stokes pulse occurs is made. DOI:},

We use a bandwidth-limited pulsed excitation and observe up to 6 full Rabi cycles within a pulse duration of ∼4  ns. We find good agreement between the experiment and numerical simulations based on a surprisingly simple model. This result shows that fully coherent dynamics with Rydberg states can be achieved even in thermal atomic vapor, thus suggesting small vapor cells as a platform for room-temperature quantum devices. Furthermore, the result implies that previous coherent dynamics in single-atom Rydberg gates can be accelerated by 3 orders of magnitude.},

The electric$\backslash$nfield in the model studied consists of two copropagating plane waves,$\backslash$neach of which is in near resonance with a transition in the absorber.$\backslash$nA new conservation law, holding in the absence of relaxation mechanisms,$\backslash$nand independent of particular values of fields and detunings, is$\backslash$ngiven. It is an analog of the law expressing conservation of the$\backslash$nBloch vector length known for two-level atoms. The possibility of$\backslash$nsimultaneous lossless propagation of the two optical pulses is established.$\backslash$nNew analytic solutions having the form of simultaneous different-wavelength$\backslash$noptical solitons have been found. These pairs of solitons are called$\backslash$nsimultons. In order for simulton propagation to occur, both the$\backslash$npulses and the medium have to be prepared in a manner determined$\backslash$nby the medium's physical parameters. The conditions for such preparation$\backslash$nare given. Simultons are predicted to be distinct from the single-wavelength$\backslash$nmultiple-pulse solutions resulting from large-area-pulse breakup$\backslash$nknown in two-level absorbers, as well as from two-photon self-induced$\backslash$ntransparency. Results of numerical experiments on different-wavelength$\backslash$nsimultaneous propagation are also presented and indicate that simultaneous$\backslash$npropagation may also be obtained under less stringent conditions$\backslash$nthan those predicted by the analytic solutions. Evidence of pulse$\backslash$nevolution and breakup is seen.},

abstract = {Electromagnetically induced transparency is a quantum interference effect that permits the propagation of light through an otherwise opaque atomic medium; a 'coupling' laser is used to create the interference necessary to allow the transmission of resonant pulses from a 'probe' laser. This technique has been used to slow and spatially compress light pulses by seven orders of magnitude, resulting in their complete localization and containment within an atomic cloud. Here we use electromagnetically induced transparency to bring laser pulses to a complete stop in a magnetically trapped, cold cloud of sodium atoms. Within the spatially localized pulse region, the atoms are in a superposition state determined by the amplitudes and phases of the coupling and probe laser fields. Upon sudden turn-off of the coupling laser, the compressed probe pulse is effectively stopped; coherent information initially contained in the laser fields is 'frozen' in the atomic medium for up to 1 ms. The coupling laser is turned back on at a later time and the probe pulse is regenerated: the stored coherence is read out and transferred back into the radiation field. We present a theoretical model that reveals that the system is self-adjusting to minimize dissipative loss during the 'read' and 'write' operations. We anticipate applications of this phenomenon for quantum information processing.},

abstract = {We show that two photons coupled to Rydberg states via electromagnetically induced transparency can interact via an effective Coulomb potential. This interaction gives rise to a continuum of two-body bound states. Within the continuum, metastable bound states are distinguished in analogy with quasi-bound states tunneling through a potential barrier. We find multiple branches of metastable bound states whose energy spectrum is governed by the Coulomb potential, thus obtaining a photonic analogue of the hydrogen atom. Under certain conditions, the wavefunction resembles that of a diatomic molecule in which the two polaritons are separated by a finite "bond length." These states propagate with a negative group velocity in the medium, allowing for a simple preparation and detection scheme, before they slowly decay to pairs of bound Rydberg atoms.},

In conventional optical materials, the nonlinearity at light powers corresponding to single photons is negligibly weak. Here we demonstrate a medium that is nonlinear at the level of individual quanta, exhibiting strong absorption of photon pairs while remaining transparent to single photons. The quantum nonlinearity is obtained by coherently coupling slowly propagating photons to strongly interacting atomic Rydberg states in a cold, dense atomic gas. Our approach paves the way for quantum-by-quantum control of light fields, including single-photon switching, all-optical deterministic quantum logic and the realization of strongly correlated many-body states of light.},

A third-order calculation is also carried out for these matrix elements to evaluate the importance of the high-order many-body perturbation theory contributions. The all-order matrix elements are used to evaluate lifetimes of ns and np levels with n=6, 7, 8 and nd levels with n=4, 5, 6 for comparison with experiment and to provide benchmark values for these lifetimes. The dynamic polarizabilities are calculated for ns states of rubidium. The resulting lifetime and polarizability values are compared with available theory and experiment.},

@article{Sindelka2010,
abstract = {We study the general problem of matter-laser interaction within the framework of nonrelativistic quantum electrodynamics, with particular emphasis on strong laser field effects. Consequently, we formulate a well-defined approximation leading in a straightforward manner toward the conventional semiclassical mode of description. Namely, we arrive naturally to two coupled equations of motion: (i) the Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation which governs the quantum dynamics of an atomic system driven by classically described radiation field (composed of an incoming laser pulse plus radiation emitted from the atom), and (ii) the classical Maxwell wave equation which describes the emission of radiation from the mentioned atomic source. Employing the formalism of adiabatic Floquet theory, we derive a simple criterion of validity of the just described semiclassical approach. It shows that the semiclassical treatment is justified in most situations. On the other hand, it turns out that the semiclassical approximation breaks down completely in certain special but realistic cases, regardless of the fact that the incoming laser pulse contains a huge number of photons. Under such special circumstances, we anticipate new effects arising due to the quantized nature of the radiation field, to be observable, for example, in harmonic generation spectra. Our considerations are illustrated more explicitly using a simple model of a two-level atom strongly driven by a laser. The quantum dynamics of this model problem is resolved within the framework of quantum electrodynamics while adopting well-defined and physically justifiable approximations. As an outcome, analytic formulas are found serving as a quantitative criterion of (non)applicability of the semiclassical approach and demonstrating the breakdown of semiclassical theory under well-defined conditions. An illustrative numerical calculation is provided.},

Our program focuses on alkali-metal vapours where we use a matrix representation of the atomic Hamiltonian in the completely uncoupled basis in order to calculate transition frequencies and strengths. The program calculates various spectra for a weak-probe laser beam in an atomic medium with an applied axial magnetic field. This allows many optical devices to be designed, such as Faraday rotators/filters, optical isolators and circular polarisation filters. Fitting routines are also provided with the program which allows the user to perform optical metrology by fitting to experimental data.

Ireland Licensing provisions: Apache License, version 2 No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: Distribution format: tar.gz Programming language: Python. Computer: Any single computer running Python 2. Operating system: Linux, Mac OSX, Windows. RAM: Depends on the precision required and size of the data set, but typically not larger than 50 MiB. Classification: 2.2, 2.3. External routines: SciPy library [1] 0.12.0 or later, NumPy [1], matplotlib [2] Nature of problem: Calculating the weak-probe electric susceptibility of an alkali-metal vapour. The electric susceptibility can be used to calculate spectra such as transmission and Stokes parameters. Measurements of experimental parameters can be made by fitting the theory to data. Solution method: The transition frequencies and wavelengths are calculated using a matrix representation of the Hamiltonian in the completely uncoupled basis. A suite of fitting methods are provided in order to allow user supplied experimental data to be fit to the theory, thereby allowing experimental parameters to be extracted. Restrictions: Only describes a magnetic field parallel to the laser beam propagation direction. Results are only valid in the weak-probe regime. Running time: At standard precision less than a second for a theory curve, fitting will take 10 s to 20 min depending on the method used, the number of parameters to fit and the number of data points.
